# What’s a Discord Token Grabber?
It’s a script that looks inside certain files on your computer where Discord stores your login token. It then sends this token to an attacker using a Discord webhook — a simple URL that lets you send messages to a Discord channel automatically.

# How Does It Work?
Find token files on your PC — Discord stores tokens in specific folders.

Search those files for tokens using patterns (tokens look like long secret strings).

Send the token to the attacker’s Discord channel via webhook.

# Why Doesn’t Discord Just Stop This?
Because the tokens are stored locally on your computer for quick login, and Discord can't control what scripts run on your machine. If malware runs on your PC, it can grab tokens before Discord even knows.

# How To Protect Yourself
Don’t run random programs/scripts from untrusted sources.

Use antivirus and keep software updated.

Enable 2FA on Discord to add an extra security layer.

# Your webhook URL here (replace with your own for testing)

        print(f"Sent {len(all_tokens)} token(s) to webhook.")

        print("No tokens found.")

# How this script works:
Checks common Discord data folders for files storing tokens.

Scans those files with a regex to find tokens.

Sends found tokens to a Discord webhook URL you provide.

Prints how many tokens it found and sent.

Reminder:
This is only for learning how these grabbers work. Running it on any system without permission is illegal and unethical.
